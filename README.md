# Anime-Generative Adversarial Networks in PyTorch
In this notebook, I have created Face of Anime Characters using Generative Adversarial Network.

> Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that involves automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset. - [Source](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-are-generative-adversarial-networks-gans/)

From Random noise to Anime faces.

### Network
The two neural networks used are: a Generator and a Discriminator. The generator generates a "fake" sample given a random vector/matrix, and the discriminator attempts to detect whether a given sample is "real" (picked from the training data) or "fake" (generated by the generator). Training happens in tandem: we train the discriminator for a few epochs, then train the generator for a few epochs, and repeat. This way both the generator and the discriminator get better at doing their jobs.

GANs are however notoriously difficult to train, and are extremely sensitive to hyperparameters, activation functions and regularization.

### Dataset

The dataset used is the [Anime Face Dataset](https://github.com/Mckinsey666/Anime-Face-Dataset), which consists of over 63,000 cropped anime faces.
